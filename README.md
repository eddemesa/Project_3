Project Report: ETL Pipeline

TXT File Contents

Create a TXT file named Project_3.txt with the following content:

Project Repository: https://github.com/eddemesa/Project_3

This repository contains the following components:

1. ETL Script: The ETL script is implemented using the object-oriented programming paradigm. 
    It processes and transforms data from the source to the destination.

2. README.md: 
	- Building and Activating the Virtual Environment: 

		To create and activate a virtual environment, use the following commands:

		python3 -m venv venv
		source  venv/bin/activate 

	-Running the Code:
 
		After activating the virtual environment, run the ETL script with:

		python etl.py

	-Generating a flake8-html Report: 

		To generate a flake8 report, run the following command:
		
		flake8 --format=html --output-file=flake8_report.html

3. flake8-html Report: 
	
		This report shows that the code adheres to PEP 8 guidelines, ensuring code quality and readability.

4. Cleaned and Prepared Data:

		 A ZIP file containing the cleaned and prepared data, which is the output of the ETL pipeline, 
		along with a requirements document.

5. Stakeholder Email: 

		Attached is a PDF document that describes how the ETL pipeline manages the required data.


		GitHub Repository Structure
			The GitHub repository should have the following structure:
			Code
			/https://github.com/eddemesa/Project_3
			│
			├── etl_script.py # The ETL script
			├── README.md # Instructions
			├── flake8_report.html # flake8 report

1. ETL Script
* Ensure that the ETL script (etl_script.py) is written using object-oriented programming principles, encapsulating functionality within classes and methods.
2. README.md
* Provide clear instructions for users to build and activate the virtual environment, run the ETL script, and generate the flake8 report.
3. flake8-html Report
* Use the flake8 tool to analyze your code, ensuring it meets PEP 8 standards, and generate an HTML report named flake8_report.html.
4. ZIP File
* Create a ZIP file named cleaned_data.zip containing all cleaned and prepared data output from the ETL process. 
* Include a requirements.txt document listing all dependencies required to run the ETL pipeline.
5. Stakeholder Email
* Draft a professional email to project stakeholders explaining how the ETL pipeline manages the data requirements. 
* Save this email as a PDF document named stakeholder_report.pdf.
